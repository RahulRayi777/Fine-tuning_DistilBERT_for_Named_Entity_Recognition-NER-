# Fine-tuning_DistilBERT_for_Named_Entity_Recognition-NER-
This project fine-tunes DistilBERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to improve restaurant search by identifying key entities in user queries

Project: Restaurant Search NER Recognition by Fine-Tuning DistilBERT

Restaurant Names (e.g., "Find me a table at Olive Garden")

Cuisine Types (e.g., "Show me the best Italian restaurants")

Locations (e.g., "Find a sushi place in Los Angeles")

By fine-tuning DistilBERT, a lightweight and efficient transformer model, we can achieve high accuracy and fast performance in understanding user queries for restaurant search.

Key Features of the Project

✅ Fine-tuning DistilBERT: Training on a labeled dataset of restaurant-related text to improve entity recognition.

✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting important entities such as locations, restaurant names, and cuisine types.

✅ Efficient Search System: Enhancing restaurant search by understanding natural language queries.

✅ Real-Time Processing: Using DistilBERT for fast inference, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Gather restaurant-related text data.

Label data with entity tags (e.g., "I love Pizza Hut" → "B-RESTAURANT").

2️⃣ Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for NER

Load a pre-trained DistilBERT model.

Fine-tune it using Hugging Face Transformers & PyTorch.

3️⃣ Model Evaluation

Validate performance using accuracy, F1-score, and entity extraction metrics.

4️⃣ Deployment & Integration

Deploy the model via a Flask API or FastAPI for integration with restaurant search apps.
